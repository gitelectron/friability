Live Demo: (https://youtu.be/CLTHbqNzNO0)

Components: TFT resistive touch display (spi) + motor + motor driver + mcu + thermal printer(rs232)

Info: Friability is used to measure the drug's loss in medicines during transportation, and hence, building 
such an environment using motors and other hardware, and writing required software/firmware for motors and 
touch display, hence building an HMI system.
